## Load the landmarks

First, load the landmark scaffolds.  The repo includes a FASTA file with scaffold names only, no sequences, for this purpose.  Use the FASTA loader as described in the mRNA section: you do not need to define a parent relationship.  You can use the SO term contig for the [type](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/so/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FSO_0000149).

## Load the GFF file
Consider the example GFF file below.

```

### Preprocessing

Every line of the GFF file will result in a **new feature**. The above example will create gene, mRNA, five_prime_UTR, exon, CDS, **and protein** features (see below for how to skip protein creation).  If you'd like to not load five_prime_UTR features, for example, delete them from the file beforehand.

### The GFF Importer

First, upload the file.  In order to use the GUI uploader, the file extension should be `.gff` or `.gff3`.  See below for information on GFF types.

#### Landmark Type

The **landmark** is the Chado feature on which the individual features are being mapped.  This is typically a scaffold, contig, or chromosome (we chose contig above).  If your landmarks are not uniquely named for this organism, you can specify the type here.

#### Protein names
As before, you may need to specify a regexp so that your proteins are correctly linked to your mRNA.  Note that if you dont specify a protein regexp, it will look for proteins that are [mrna_name]-protein.  This could result in new proteins being inserted accidentally!  I've submitted a change that will allow you to **skip creating proteins** in this manner, look for it soon.


## A note on GFF versions

GFF files are not the most uniform files around.  There are GFF, GFF2, GTF, and GFF3.  The Tripal GFF loader does its best, but it was designed to work withGFF3.
